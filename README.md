# DataGolf SDK

This is a Python SDK implementation for the [DataGolf API](https://datagolf.com/api-access). I wanted to automate a few things I was doing and found the easiest way was to create this sdk so I could access the fields easier. Hopefully its helpful to other people as well.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3 (version >= 3.7)
- A DataGolf Scratch PLUS membership

## Installation and Setup

Clone the repo and make sure you have requests and dot-env

pip install python-dotenv
pip install requests

Create a .env file with your apikey in the root -
apikey = "key here"
